# Hai Hai-
👏Hallo,everyone👏
Let me introduce my self...
I am Eka,a geophysics undergraduate student at Gadjah Mada University.
I've studied C++ programming before,but always have trouble and error on applying it😢😮.
Now,At this time,I will start to learn computational method with python language,this is the first time for me to know about python.
I hope I can understand it better than before,mohon bimbingannya,Pak.
